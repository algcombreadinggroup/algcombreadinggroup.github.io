We need to decide on the next topic for the reading group. Feel free to suggest a topic---write to Joshua Maglione.

The current suggestions are:

- [Combinatorial Species and Tree-like Structures](https://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9781107325913) (TR)
- [Lorentzian polynomials](https://doi.org/10.4007/annals.2020.192.3.4) (JM)
