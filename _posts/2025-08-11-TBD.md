We are reading texts on the representation theory of finite groups. Our first source is
- [Representation Theory of Finite Groups: a Guidebook](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-21792-1) by [David Craven](https://web.mat.bham.ac.uk/D.A.Craven/)

We meet on Wednesday at 2:00pm. Contact [Joshua Maglione](mailto:joshua.maglione@universityofgalway.ie) if you are interested in joining.
