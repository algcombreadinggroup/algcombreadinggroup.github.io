We are reading texts that cover the somewhat new field of combinatorial Hodge theory. Our primary sources are
- [Combinatorics and Hodge Theory](https://web.math.princeton.edu/~huh/ICM2022.pdf) by [June Huh](https://web.math.princeton.edu/~huh/),
- [Hodge theory for matroids](https://people.math.harvard.edu/~jxwang/HodgeTheoryMatroids.pdf) by [Joshua Wang](https://math.mit.edu/~joshuaxw/)

We meet on Fridays at 1:00pm. Contact [Joshua Maglione](mailto:joshua.maglione@universityofgalway.ie) if you are interested in joining.
