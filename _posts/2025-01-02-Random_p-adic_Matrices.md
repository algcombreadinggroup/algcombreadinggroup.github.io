We need to decide on a topic to discuss for the semester. Here is the current list of suggestions:
1. Lorentzian polynomials (JM)
	- [Lorentzian polynomials](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.1902.03719) by Petter Brändén and June Huh
	- [Combinatorics and Hodge theory](https://doi.org/10.4171/icm2022/205) by June Huh
2. Representation stability (TR)
	- [Structures in Representation Stability](https://doi.org/10.1090/noti2011) by Steven V Sam 
	- [Representation stability](https://math.uchicago.edu/~farb/papers/ICM-webpage.pdf) by Benson Farb
3. Random matrices and Cohen--Lenstra heuristics (JM)



We are reading texts on the theory of random $p$-adic matrices and Cohen--Lenstra heuristics. Our sources are
- [Universality of cokernels of random matrix products](https://doi-org.nuigalway.idm.oclc.org/10.1016/j.aim.2023.109451) by [Hoi H. Nguyen](https://people.math.osu.edu/nguyen.1261/) and [Roger Van Peski](https://www.math.columbia.edu/~rv2549/)
- [Random integral matrices and the Cohen--Lenstra heuristics](https://doi.org/10.1353/ajm.2019.0008) by [Melanie Matchett Wood](https://people.math.harvard.edu/~mmwood/)

We meet on Wednesday at 2:00pm. Contact [Joshua Maglione](mailto:joshua.maglione@universityofgalway.ie) if you are interested in joining.
